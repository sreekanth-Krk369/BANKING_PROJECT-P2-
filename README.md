# üìä Bank Customer Churn Analysis ‚Äì Turning Data into Retention Strategies  

## üéØ Project Objective  
In the banking industry, **losing customers means losing revenue, trust, and long-term value**. My objective was to analyze **why customers leave** and develop **data-driven retention strategies** using **SQL, Power BI, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Excel**.  

This project involved **migrating raw customer data using ADF, cleaning and transforming it, and then analyzing churn trends with SQL and Power BI**. The final outcome? **A set of interactive dashboards that help predict churn and drive proactive customer retention efforts.**

##  (*) The Business Challenge: Rising Churn & Lost Revenue  

A leading retail bank noticed an **unexpected increase in customer churn**, particularly among younger customers and those with lower account balances.  

üí° **The business impact was significant:**  
- ‚ùå **Over 2,000+ customers** were leaving every year, affecting revenue.  
- ‚ùå **Lower engagement from inactive customers** led to reduced cross-sell opportunities.  
- ‚ùå **Churn was highest in specific regions**, hinting at **branch-level service issues**.  
- ‚ùå **Credit card adoption was low**, despite being a key factor in retention.  

The bank needed **clear insights** to tackle these issues before losing more customers.

## üõ† My Approach: How I Solved It  

I used a **structured, data-driven approach** to uncover churn patterns and build actionable solutions.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Migration & Cleaning (ADF + SQL + Excel)**  
‚úÖ **Extracted & migrated** raw data from multiple sources using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**.  
‚úÖ **Cleaned & transformed** the data using SQL, removing duplicates and handling missing values.  
‚úÖ Used **Excel for initial data validation**, ensuring data consistency before analysis.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI + SQL)**  
‚úÖ Designed **interactive Power BI dashboards** to visualize customer churn trends.  
‚úÖ Ran **SQL queries** to segment customers by **credit score, tenure, activity level, and product adoption**.  
‚úÖ Discovered that **inactive customers had a 60% higher chance of leaving**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Strategy & Solutions**  
Based on the insights, I developed **three key strategies** to reduce churn:  

#### ‚úÖ **1. Customer Re-Engagement Strategy** üì©  
- Identified **inactive customers** using **SQL-based queries** and flagged them in Power BI.  
- Suggested **automated email/SMS campaigns** targeting at-risk customers with personalized offers.  

#### ‚úÖ **2. Credit Card & Multi-Product Upselling** üí≥  
- Used Power BI reports to **find customers without credit cards** and suggested **targeted promotions**.  
- Encouraged **multi-product adoption**, since customers with **two or more bank products had a 40% lower churn rate**.  

#### ‚úÖ **3. Regional & Demographic-Based Retention Offers** üåç  
- Used **Power BI heatmaps** to identify **high-churn regions**, enabling **branch-level retention efforts**.  
- Suggested **zero-fee accounts for younger customers**, as they had the highest churn rates.

## üìÇ Bank Customer Churn Analysis - Simplified SQL Query List

These queries support key insights used in the Bank Churn Analysis project, helping identify at-risk customers, product gaps, and churn patterns.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inactive Customers (No activity in 90 days)
```sql
SELECT customer_id, MAX(transaction_date) AS last_txn_date
FROM transactions
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING CURRENT_DATE - MAX(transaction_date) > 90;
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Customers Without Credit Card
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM accounts
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN account_type = 'Credit Card' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Churn Rate by Age Group
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
    WHEN age <= 40 THEN '25-40'
    WHEN age <= 60 THEN '41-60'
    ELSE '60+' 
  END AS age_group,
  ROUND(100.0 * AVG(churn_flag), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM customers
GROUP BY age_group;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Product Adoption vs Churn
```sql
SELECT 
  num_products,
  COUNT(*) AS customers,
  ROUND(100.0 * AVG(churn_flag), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT account_type) AS num_products
  FROM accounts
  GROUP BY customer_id

SELECT 
  region,
  COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
  ROUND(100.0 * AVG(churn_flag), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM customers
