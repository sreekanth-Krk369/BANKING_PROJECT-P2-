# 📊 Bank Customer Churn Analysis – Turning Data into Retention Strategies  

## 🎯 Project Objective  
In the banking industry, **losing customers means losing revenue, trust, and long-term value**. My objective was to analyze **why customers leave** and develop **data-driven retention strategies** using **SQL, Power BI, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Excel**.  

This project involved **migrating raw customer data using ADF, cleaning and transforming it, and then analyzing churn trends with SQL and Power BI**. The final outcome? **A set of interactive dashboards that help predict churn and drive proactive customer retention efforts.**

##  (*) The Business Challenge: Rising Churn & Lost Revenue  

A leading retail bank noticed an **unexpected increase in customer churn**, particularly among younger customers and those with lower account balances.  

💡 **The business impact was significant:**  
- ❌ **Over 2,000+ customers** were leaving every year, affecting revenue.  
- ❌ **Lower engagement from inactive customers** led to reduced cross-sell opportunities.  
- ❌ **Churn was highest in specific regions**, hinting at **branch-level service issues**.  
- ❌ **Credit card adoption was low**, despite being a key factor in retention.  

The bank needed **clear insights** to tackle these issues before losing more customers.

## 🛠 My Approach: How I Solved It  

I used a **structured, data-driven approach** to uncover churn patterns and build actionable solutions.  

### **1️⃣ Data Migration & Cleaning (ADF + SQL + Excel)**  
✅ **Extracted & migrated** raw data from multiple sources using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**.  
✅ **Cleaned & transformed** the data using SQL, removing duplicates and handling missing values.  
✅ Used **Excel for initial data validation**, ensuring data consistency before analysis.  

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI + SQL)**  
✅ Designed **interactive Power BI dashboards** to visualize customer churn trends.  
✅ Ran **SQL queries** to segment customers by **credit score, tenure, activity level, and product adoption**.  
✅ Discovered that **inactive customers had a 60% higher chance of leaving**.  

### **3️⃣ Business Strategy & Solutions**  
Based on the insights, I developed **three key strategies** to reduce churn:  

#### ✅ **1. Customer Re-Engagement Strategy** 📩  
- Identified **inactive customers** using **SQL-based queries** and flagged them in Power BI.  
- Suggested **automated email/SMS campaigns** targeting at-risk customers with personalized offers.  

#### ✅ **2. Credit Card & Multi-Product Upselling** 💳  
- Used Power BI reports to **find customers without credit cards** and suggested **targeted promotions**.  
- Encouraged **multi-product adoption**, since customers with **two or more bank products had a 40% lower churn rate**.  

#### ✅ **3. Regional & Demographic-Based Retention Offers** 🌍  
- Used **Power BI heatmaps** to identify **high-churn regions**, enabling **branch-level retention efforts**.  
- Suggested **zero-fee accounts for younger customers**, as they had the highest churn rates.
